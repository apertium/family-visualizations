# Ling073-Final

Welcome to the repo for my 3D Apertium Pairviewer! This project was made as a final for my Computation Linguistics class. The page is a simple way of visualizing the language pairs currently in Apertium (and also the language pairs worked on for the class).

## To Run:
Simply clone the repository. To run locally, I use a PythonHTTPServer:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888 &
```
Then, you can direct your browser to <http://localhost:8888/> to view. 

To add or modify point data, change the apertiumPairs.json file.

## Files:
* apertium-languages.tsv -- This file contains the coordinates of certain languages in Apertium.

* apertiumPairs.json -- Contains all of the pair data and point data used

* index.html -- HTML and CSS

* languages.json -- Contains mappings from ISO language codes to full language names

* ling073Pairs.json -- Contains the data for only the pairs created in-class

* pairs.json.txt -- Contains the information used by the Apertium pairviewer

* pairviewer.js -- Body of the page

* places.json -- Example data that I used when starting out

* trimpairs.py -- Short Python script that scrapes the pairs.json.txt and the apertium-languages.tsv file. Creates a trimmed set of the Apertium data (only the language pairs that have coordinates in the tsv file). Writes the information to the apertiumPairs.json file

* world-110m.json -- Country data used for generating the globe
